    """A component of a dataset (aka **variable**), such the frequency.

    Concepts are used to **describe the relevant characteristics** of a
    statistical domain. For example, exchanges rates might be described with
    components such as the numerator currency, the denominator currency,
    the type of exchange rates, etc.

    Some of these components are expected to be useful **across statistical
    domains**. Examples of such components include the frequency, the
    observation status, the confidentiality, etc.

    When using components to describe the expected structure of a statistical
    domain, data stewards distinguish between the components that represent
    what is being captured (i.e. the **measures**), the components that help
    uniquely **identifying** the measures (i.e. the dimensions) and the
    components that provide additional **descriptive information** about the
    measures (i.e. the attributes). This is the **component role**. The role
    can be *D* (for Dimension), *A* (for Attribute) or *M* (for Measure).

    While dimensions and measures are typically mandatory, attributes may be
    either **mandatory or optional**. This is captured in the *required*
    property using a boolean value (*true* for mandatory components, *false*
    otherwise). This may vary with the statistical domain, i.e. a mandatory
    component within a particular domain may be optional in another.

    While the value of some attributes is expected to potentially vary with
    each *measurement* (aka observation or data point), some others must be
    unique across all observations sharing the same (sub)set of dimension
    values. This is captured in the *attachment_level* property, which can be
    one of: *D* (for Dataset), *O* (for Observation), any string identifying a
    component ID (FREQ) or comma-separated list of component IDs
    (FREQ,REF_AREA). The latter can be used to identify the dimension, group
    or series to which the attribute is attached. The attachment level of a
    component may vary with the statistical domain, i.e. a component attached
    to a series in a particular domain may be attached to, say, the dataset in
    another domain.

    The *codes* field indicates the expected (i.e. allowed) set of values a
    component can take within a particular domain. In addition to
    (or instead of) a set of codes, additional details about the expected
    format may be found in the *facets* and *dtype* fields.


    Attributes:
        id: A unique identifier for the component (e.g. FREQ).
        required: Whether the component must have a value.
        role: The role played by the component.
        local_dtype: The component's local data type (string, number, etc.).
        local_facets: Additional local details such as the component's minimum
            length.
        name: The component's name.
        description: Additional descriptive information about the component.
        local_codes: The expected local values for the component (e.g. currency
            codes).
        attachment_level: The attachement level (if role = A only).

            D (for dataset-level attributes), O (for observation-level
            attributes) or a combination of dimension IDs, separated by
            commas, for series- and group-level attributes).
