"""Model for SDMX Codes and Codelists.

Two different types of collections are provided:

- Codelist: A flat structure, i.e. a structure where all codes are at the same
  level. In SDMX terms, this structure can be fed from information stored
  as a *codelist* or a *value list*.
- Hierarchy: A structure where codes can be organized in a hierarchical
  fashion, like a list of country groups and their respective countries.

This is an example of what is meant with pysdmx being opinionated.
While SDMX allows two different types of hierarchies (simple hierarchies
expressed as codelists, and more complex hierarchies expressed as SDMX
hierarchies), pysdmx expects codelists and value lists to be flat (which
seems to be the vast majority of the cases), thereby leaving the
representation of hierarchical relationships to hierarchies only.
