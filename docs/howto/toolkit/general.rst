General
=======

The toolkit module is a collection of utility functions for user
convenience when working with pysdmx in combination with other standards such as VTL
or SDMX-based tools like the FMR.

The toolkit functions does not follow any particular
version of the SDMX standard, we will try our best to not include any
change that breaks backward compatibility but we cannot ensure it.
